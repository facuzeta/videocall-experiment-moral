This file explains the data in the files "metrics.csv" and "behaviour.csv".

1. "behaviour.csv"

Each row corresponds to the answers provided by one of the two participants of each dyad. 

- Column "B" indicates whether they have (1) or have not (2) reached an agreement, and column "C" depicts the value they agreed to.  
Columns "D" to "K" correspond to the answers provided in the conversation assessment, in which each participant qualified the following aspects on a 7-point scale (1= strongly disagree; 7= strongly agree): 
- "Column D": I felt this interaction was enjoyable;
- "Column E": I felt this interaction was very stressful;
- "Column F": I felt judged by the other participant;
- "Column G": I felt comfortable in this interaction;
- "Column H": I felt this interaction was difficult to get through;
- "Column I": I am willing to engage in more interactions like this;
- "Column J": I see value in engaging in interactions like this one;
- "Column K": Reaching an agreement was extremely hard to achieve.

- Columns "L" to "S" correspond to the answers provided in the partner assessment, in which each participant qualified the following aspects on a on a 7-point scale (1= strongly disagree; 7= strongly agree): 
- "Column L": I believe their ideas were valid;
- "Column M": I believe their ideas were convincing;
- "Column N": I think I can respect their opinions;
- "Column O": I believe their statements were driven by emotion;
- "Column P": I believe their statements were driven by logic;
- "Column Q": I think I can like them as a person;
- "Column R": I think I am willing to talk with them again;
- "Column S": I think their arguments had an impact in my own opinion about the issue.

Missing values are expressed as -999


2. "metrics.csv"

Each row corresponds to the values of the metrics of each dyad. 

- Columns "B" to "G" show the maximum (F0_MAX) or minimum (FO_MIN) pitch value for each acoustic-prosodic variable measured (synchrony, convergence, and proximity). 

- Columns "H" to "P" show the pitch mean, median, and standard deviation (STDV) values for each acoustic-prosodic variable measured (synchrony, convergence, and proximity). 

- Columns "Q" to "S" show the pitch mean absolute slope (MAS) for each acoustic-prosodic variable measured (synchrony, convergence, and proximity). 

- Columns "T" to "Y" show the m√°ximum (ENG_MAX) or minimum (ENG_MIN) intensity value for each acoustic-prosodic variable measured (synchrony, convergence, and proximity).

- Columns "Z" to "AE" show the intensity mean, median, and standard deviation (STDV) values for each acoustic-prosodic variable measured (synchrony, convergence, and proximity). 

- Columns "AF" to "AH" show the ratio of the sounding frame values for each acoustic-prosodic variable measured (synchrony, convergence, and proximity).

- Columns "AI" to "AK" show the speech rate for each acoustic-prosodic variable measured (synchrony, convergence, and proximity).
